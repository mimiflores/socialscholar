			<h1>☆Study Tips☆ </h1>
			<p style="text-align:center">Let's be honest: no one ever <i>really</i> tells you the right way to study. Study tips are not taught in school! The truth is, study methods work differently for different people. Try out a few of these study methods and find which one works best for <b>YOU!</b></p>

			<h2>Practice Active Recall</h2> <br>
			<h3>About Active Recall</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.brainscape.com/academy/active-recall-definition-studying/">Active recall</a> is a retrieval practice in which you continuously quiz yourself to determine what you do and do not know. You may not know it, but you have probably already practiced this study method! If you've ever quizzed yourself on a question without checking the answer or used flashcards to test what you know, that's active recall! Although this method may not apply to certain subjects, including math, it is a very beneficial practice for history and science classes.

			<h3>How To Practice</h3>

			<ul style="text-align:left">
				<li><strong>Short Quizzes</strong> Ask yourself questions based on your notes! Just close your notebook and quiz yourself, you don't even have to write everything out! If you miss a question, try re-reading your notes to come up with a better connection.</li>
				<li><strong>Flashcards</strong> There are two methods to practice active recall using flashcards. The first involves writing a keyword on the front and trying to remember as much about it by writing everything you know about it on the back. The second is the more traditional practice of copying keywords and writing a description about it on the back of your flashcard (make a lot of these!). When you're done you can either see if you remember the keyword by looking at the description or vice-versa. Check Quizlet to see if there are study decks made by other students or teachers available! </li>
				<li><strong>Hotdog Paper</strong> The next time you take notes, try folding your paper in half first! Unfold and write your questions on the left and the answers on the right. When you're studying, fold the paper so that only the questions are showing. Then, recall! </li>
				<li><strong>Group Study</strong> Not only is group studying fun, but it also a great way to practice active recall. You can either quiz each other on questions or just explain different concepts to one another without using your notes.</li>
				<li><strong>Mind Maps</strong>Grab a piece of paper and recall all the keywords and concepts from your notes. Then, connect all related concepts and words on your mind map!</li>
				<li><strong>Teaching</strong>Study as if you were going to teach a class about whatever topic you are being assessed on. This will make the areas in which you should put more focus in clear and force you to explain things in your own terms.</li>
				<li><strong>Practice Questions</strong>When completing worksheets, try not to use your notes! Of course if you are required to submit it, you don't want to turn in the wrong answers. Therefore, if you don't know the answers go back and look at your notes for some help.</li>
				<li><strong>Create Something New</strong>Come up with your own examples for different topics!</li>
				<li><strong>Fill In Your Notes</strong>Create a summary sheet after writing your notes. Do this without looking at the notes you took in class. Once you cannot remember anything else, you can go back and fill in information using the notes you took in class. Then, close your notes and recall the information you wrote down!</li>
				<li><strong>Read & Remember</strong>When reading texts for your class, try and recall what you've just read about after each paragraph. If you are stuck, move on to the next paragraph and try again!</li>
