## Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected numerous individuals worldwide, including students. Online school impacted the lives of students in multiple ways and more students are developing poor study habits. Productivity has decreased due to multiple distractions that vary between students including phones, stress, pets, and being at home with family members. With more and more schools changing to in-person learning again, students are struggling to quickly develop better study habits to succeed in the coming school year. Even before the pandemic, schools have never really taught students the right way to learn or study. With Social Scholar we are hoping to combat this by compiling different study tips, note-taking methods, and other resources in one place to help students gain confidence in their study skills to achieve their goals this school year.

## What it does
Chat rooms allow you to connect with your study buddies in real-time, whenever and wherever! Practice the study and note-taking methods you learned together in your private room! Explore our collection of study strategies to ace your study game and increase your productivity! Learn more about study techniques like active recall and mind mapping, and how you can implement them into your study routine. Learn about some of the most popular note-taking methods used by students worldwide! Access free downloadable notes templates and detailed information about how you can implement these methods.

Now, as students, how are we supposed to implement this into our daily study sessions? Every day one must sit down and review the topics assigned and try to recall as much as they can. Aimlessly rereading textbooks will not help forge your neural pathways to learning the material. The long-term memory we are trying to build will only come from spacing your repeated recall of the information. Additionally, each and every time one recalls and reviews information, the more solidified the information becomes in our brains to pull from during major exams.

## How we built it
We originally started with a Google Document where we stored all of our ideas. We came up with an idea to help students who were impacted by COVID-19 and from there, we started to plan how we would bring our idea to life. We decided to use Qoom to make a web app, but we also used Figma to design how we wanted the site to look. Most of Saturday was spent actually coding on Qoom. Although we ran into some issues along the way, we all helped one another and learned the importance of teamwork when working on a project like this.

We also used the How To Build A Chat App Qoom Template here https://app.qoom.io/projects/chat-app/guide.md to help with making the study chat room. We used the code from there and switched some things around to make it work for our web app.

## Challenges we ran into
Differences between the Figma and Qoom designs made the development process difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Throughout our process of making this website, our most significant accomplishment was the live interactive study chat room. We didn’t think we could create a live chat room but after researching and testing out different solutions we ended up being able to make the chat room. We’re also proud of our study techniques as we truly believe that if students were to implement these strategies along with our guide spreadsheets/templates, they will succeed in school.

## What we learned
Throughout this process, we learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration. We were all grateful to have had the chance to work with one another and share our talents.

## What's next for Social Scholar
In the future, we hope to expand our Study Chat Room feature. We plan on allowing users to have video calls with one another in addition to sending chat messages and allow users to create new rooms for different study groups. Throughout this development process, privacy features will be added to protect the safety of our users while they are video calling and chatting on our web app. Online safety is imperative to society today, and we want to make sure that everyone feels comfortable when using Social Scholar.
