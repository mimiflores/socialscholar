			<h2>About Social Scholars</h2> <br>
			<h3>COVID-19 & Its Impact On Students</h3>
			<p>
				The COVID-19 pandemic has affected numerous individuals worldwide, including students. Online school impacted the lives of students in multiple ways and more students are developing poor study habits. Productivity has decreased due to multiple distractions that vary between students including phones, stress, pets, and being at home with family members. With more and more schools changing to in-person learning again, students are struggling to quickly develop better study habits to succeed in the coming school year. Even before the pandemic, schools have never really taught students the right way to learn or study. With <i>Social Scholar</i> we are hoping to combat this by compiling different study tips, note-taking methods, and other resources in one place to help students gain confidence in their study skills to achieve their goals this school year. </p> <br>


			<h3>Planning Process & Development</h3>
			<p> We originally started with a Google Document where we stored all of our ideas. We came up with an idea to help students who were impacted by COVID-19 and from there, we started to plan how we would bring our idea to life. We decided to use Qoom to make a web app, but we also used Figma to design how we wanted the site to look. Most of Saturday was spent actually coding on Qoom. Although we ran into some issues along the way, we all helped one another and learned the importance of teammwork when working on a project like this.</p> <br>
			<h3>Plans For The Future</h3>


			<p>

				In the future, we hope to expand our Study Chat Room feature. We plan on allowing users to have video calls with one another in addition to sending chat messages, and allow users to create new rooms for different study groups. Throughout this development process, privacy features will be added to protect the safety of our users while they are video calling and chatting on our web app. Online saftey is imperative to society today, and we want to make sure that everyone feels comfortable when using Social Scholar.
