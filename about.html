		<h2>Minnah Basit</h2>
		<h3>Hi everyone I’m Minnah Basit an incoming college freshman at UC Santa Cruz! Looking back at my academic journey I’ve realized we were taught little to nothing on how to study efficiently. Most of us figured out our own techniques but with Social Scholars students can learn note-taking strategies while also referring to templates and techniques to support their education. I have coding experience in HTML, Swift, and I’m learning Java. I’m grateful I got to participate in Elevate Hacks because of how much it has taught me about coding CSS, web design, and most importantly team collaboration!

		<h2>Shrima Narasimhan</h2>
		<h3>Hi! I’m Shrima, a rising high school junior. I can code in Java, Python, HTML/CSS, C, and I’m also familiar with SQL. Maintaining focus and productivity during quarantine has been difficult for so many of us - I believe that Social Scholars can help solve that problem by providing actionable study tips and an environment to easily chat with study buddies. I had a lot of fun participating in Elevate Hacks with this team and I hope you enjoy exploring our website!
